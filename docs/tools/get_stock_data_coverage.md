# `get_stock_data_coverage`

Inspect stored stock data availability and date coverage by source, optionally scoped to tickers or dates. Reports prices, indicators, alerts and active user notes. Use when data is missing or the user asks what stock information is available. Company fundamentals, news, live quotes, brokerage positions and trading are not stored. Notes are current text, not historical revisions.

## Arguments

### `tickers`

Optional canonical ticker symbols, case-insensitive. Omit to query all stored tickers. No automatic company-name or portfolio inference.

### `period`

Optional structured period: 2w, 14d, 3mo, 1y, today, yesterday, this_week, last_week, this_month, last_month, ytd, or all. Numeric periods include today (2w = 14 calendar days). Weeks run Sunday–Saturday. The tool calculates dates in America/Phoenix. Do not combine with explicit start_date/end_date.

### `start_date`

Optional inclusive YYYY-MM-DD lower bound. Use explicit dates only when supplied by the user; prefer period for relative requests.

### `end_date`

Optional inclusive YYYY-MM-DD upper bound. Defaults to as_of. Cannot exceed as_of.

### `as_of`

Optional YYYY-MM-DD reference/evaluation date for historical questions. Defaults to today in America/Phoenix; cannot be in the future.
